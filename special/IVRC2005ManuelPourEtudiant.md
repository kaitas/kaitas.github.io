You get a chance to go to Japan as a ''finalist'' of IVRC, the International collegiate Virtual Reality Contest.

Young students will solve them by themselves, but I, Akihiko Shirai, a lead of the Internationalization of IVRC executive committee can give some tips and information for your better understanding and preparing.
Additionally, this year is my second year to help french students.

## What should you do ''now''?

### __Improve your project!__

This is the most important comment for you just now.

### What are Japanese students doing ''now''?
They are preparing for the first stage,which is a paper review of the projects.
If their projects are accepted, they can go to the second stage, which is an aural-presentation. Normally, about 30 teams are accepted at the first stage, then only 10 projects will be qualified for the third stage, the Tokyo Stage at end of August.
Finally, 4 projects will participate to the final stage at Gifu Kakamigahara. French studens who have been awarded will join to the final stage as the finalist.

## Trip and accommodation
### Who will pay for you?
IVRC can invite 3 demonstrators to Japan from the award winning team based on a partnership between IVRC and Laval Virtual. In counterpart Laval Virtual invites 3 demonstrators to France. This partnership is contracted for the 2004 to 2006 period.

## Previous winners

### Laval Virtual Award 2003
- Dis-Tansu (Tama Univ.)
- Fragra (NAIST, Jalan)

### IVRC Award 2004

- Pinocchio, a virtual character (ENIB, Brest France )
 - Christphe LE GAL
 - Thomas JOURDAN
 - Prof. Jacques TISSEAU
 - http://www.cerv.fr/

## Duty and limitations
IVRC pays a maximum of 500,000YEN (about 3,600Euro). It includes all of costs for 1 demonstration project and its trip(local transfers, airplane, shipping, etc..) and accommodations. it means, the winners should prepare their presentation and staff for less than 500,000YEN. If the cost becomes greater than 500,000YEN, IVRC doesn't mention it but there are no additional supports.
The invited teams have to successfully show their projects to the public on the final stage of IVRC at the end of October, 2005. Even if it is difficult, they should do their best for it to work. The IVRC executive committee will help them. However, if unfortunately the invited team renounces to participate at IVRC, the representative from the team must warn IVRC(info@ivrc.net) as soon as possible. 

## Basic procedure
The organisation of IVRC and I can help make your ''basic itinerary'', i.e. air flights of Roissy(CDG) to Japan(NRT/KIX/NGO), local transfer (train and bus), accommodation (hotel and dormitory) and pickups for round trip (voyage aller et retour).
IVRC suggests a basic itinerary for 3 person when the schedule of final stage has been fixed (might be soon, [the final stage](http://ivrc.net/2005/about/compe.php) will be 27-29th, October). If your team needs **special extension** like additional person, additional place to visit and/or additional shipping equipments, please tell me of them in advance. I'll try to make a more suitable plan with the smallest possible extra cost. However, if your team informs the IVRC organisation of these whishes on a very late term, like September or October, your requirements will be difficult to realize.

IVRC transfers (sends) the cost to your bank account if the itinerary is fixed. If there are cost that is difficult to pay in advance like local transfer(ex.Japan Railways) and hotel, it will be paid at the final stage in Japan by YEN cash(please keep the receipt or memo it! Mme.Tanaka, a secretary of IVRC/VRSJ will pay for you).  All of the costs have to be under 500,000YEN. However if your team extends the costs over the awarded 500,000YEN (even though the IVRC regulation does NOT mention about it), your team has to find additional income like donation, funding or pay by yourselves.
If you and/or your organisation would like to manage it by yourselves, please tell me as soon as possible. It is easier but risky for us. So please ask me for help without any hesitation, which I will gladly do if we have time.
All of the itinerary should be fixed at the end of August.


## Is there any other helps from IVRC?
Of course, IVRC executive committee will supports you. PC equipment, cost reducing, printing material, language support, assistant volunteer, site-seeing, special party, daily dinner, etc... However, ''advance information'' is of utmost importance for us to help you.

## Special Issue on 2005
This year there are 2 winning teams from Laval Virtual. Of course, we're making the necessary preparations for both of teams. 

(now IVRC is discussing about inviting budget plan, please wait...)

Of course, it is just a plan now. Visiting to other laboratories like Prof.Tachi(U-Tokyo), Prof.Sato(TITECH) or Prof.Iwata(Univ.Tsukuba) are also possible because of they are member of executive committee. There are no additional cost suports for your additional trips however I can help your good trip in Japan!
