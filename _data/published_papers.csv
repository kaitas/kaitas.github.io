With Augmented TV, a television program is viewed through the camera of a tablet PC, and related content such as three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) is overlaid and displayed on the tablet PC. To provide users with age-targeted content, we have developed a height-estimation method based on the posture estimation method of Augmented TV, in which the height of the user is estimated from the elevation of the tablet PC off the ground. The estimated user height is then used to estimate his/her age. A public testing was carried out with around 90 elementary school students, and the data acquired was used to formulate a relationship between the elevation of the tablet PC and the height of the user. In the age estimation method proposed, the most statistically likely age for a given height was used. Therefore, we created a table containing the most statistically likely age for a given height, and the age of the user was estimated using the table. We evaluated the accuracy of both the height and age-estimations based the results of the public testing. The error in the age estimation based on the height-estimation was about 2 years of age.

Each function continuously outputs a similarity ratio between its respective target and input from the user's kinematic data. Target bone structures are defined by the developers as ideal or arbitrary values. This method is effective for a wide range of users due to its use of a kinematics data that allows for differences of length in user bones. The same target poses apply to a wide range of users through the use of a generic algorithm and user profiling.

Normally, consumer hardwares, like standard controllers of new video game platforms, are closed to public developers. The Nintendo&apos;s WiiRemote however can be connected easily to an ordinary PC thanks to a BlueTooth adapter. Thus, public developers can access to the WiiRemote&apos;s acceleration and IR sensors via this wireless connection. We think it might enlarge the non-professional game development environment with a new innovative game controller. However, when we tried to develop our projects with the WiiRemote, we encountered many difficulties because the only data that can be captured are basic data and not the full player&apos;s motion. Through the WiiMedia project, with the development of few applications, we developed some motion analysis methods using the WiiRemote.
