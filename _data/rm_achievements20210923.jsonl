Normally, consumer hardwares, like standard controllers of new video game platforms, are closed to public developers. The Nintendo&apos;s WiiRemote however can be connected easily to an ordinary PC thanks to a BlueTooth adapter. Thus, public developers can access to the WiiRemote&apos;s acceleration and IR sensors via this wireless connection. We think it might enlarge the non-professional game development environment with a new innovative game controller. However, when we tried to develop our projects with the WiiRemote, we encountered many difficulties because the only data that can be captured are basic data and not the full player&apos;s motion. Through the WiiMedia project, with the development of few applications, we developed some motion analysis methods using the WiiRemote.

No information except that seen from a single viewpoint is included in the rendered image, although 3D models are used to construct a 3D scene. Even when rendering for binocular stereopsis is performed, the viewpoints are only two. This characteristic is a limitation of the conventional 3DCG expression. In this study, we propose a new approach to 3DCG art expression. Our system uses integral photography (IP) consisting of a tablet device and a fly's eye lens. Stereoscopy is possible without the need for the user to wear special glasses even if the device is placed in any orientation because parallax is caused not only in a horizontal position but also in all directions in IP. A ready-made fly's eye lens can be combined with various tablet devices that have different screen resolutions because the extended fractional view method is used. The device is so small and lightweight that users can appreciate 3D arts at any time and place. Notably, IP can reproduce such glittering effects because each minute convex lens of the IP display emits light in different directions. We produced a 3DCG artwork, called \"Frozen Time,\" that fully employs the characteristics of our technology in motifs of \"floating ice,\" \"crystallized fossils,\" and an \"opal flower.\"."},"publisher":{"en":"Association for Computing Machinery"},"publication_date":"2014-04-09","publication_name":{"en":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series"},"volume":"2014-","languages":["eng"],"referee":true,"invited":false,"published_paper_type":"international_conference_proceedings","identifiers":{"doi":["10.1145/2617841.2620708"],"scopus_id":["84940021379"]},"see_also":[{"label":"doi","@id":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2617841.2620708","is_downloadable":false}]}}

The sharing of physical space will allow family bonding to take place by acting as a catalyst for social interaction. In order to involve more developers and artists in the search for innovative interactionenhancing content, we opened the field for content creators by proposing a Unity3D plug-in that enables multiplex imaging on 3D flat panels. Current development allows contents such as games, movies and camera feeds to be displayed on the screen, and be seen independently in real-time, either on the naked eye (main content) or through cheap polarizing glasses (hidden content).

The most valuable discovery from our project was the \"hidden imagery\" technique which can cancel an image using the other channel.

The project held two events: the first event comprised of voluntary players and the second event was self-organized and accepted as an official venue among 169 venues from 49 countries. A total of 63 participants gathered for the 6-h event, and 56% of them were first-time visitors of the museum. The progress score was the fifth highest in the world at the time."},"publisher":{"en":"Association for Computing Machinery"},"publication_date":"2015-04-08","publication_name":{"en":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series"},"volume":"08-10-","languages":["eng"],"referee":true,"invited":false,"published_paper_type":"international_conference_proceedings","identifiers":{"doi":["10.1145/2806173.2806182"],"scopus_id":["84984923503"]},"see_also":[{"label":"doi","@id":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2806173.2806182","is_downloadable":false}]}}

As a result, even the most creative artists must often go through a long and tedious period of revisions before they arrive at final creature designs that are satisfactory to the director. To reduce the amount of time and resources needed for this critical revisions stage, we have designed a prototyping tool which can use existing designs to rapidly generate unique iterations."},"publication_date":"2011","publication_name":{"en":"SIGGRAPH Asia 2011 Posters, SA'11"},"languages":["eng"],"referee":true,"invited":false,"published_paper_type":"international_conference_proceedings","identifiers":{"doi":["10.1145/2073304.2073316"],"scopus_id":["84855503681"]},"see_also":[{"label":"doi","@id":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2073304.2073316","is_downloadable":false}]}}
