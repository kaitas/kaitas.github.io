4.3 認識
VTuber とリアル・パーソン・ストリーマーの違い すべてのインタビュイーは、リアル・パーソン・ストリーマーと VTuber の両方を見たことがあり、特にプラットフォームが宣伝している VTuber をより多く見ている傾向があった。VTuber とリアル・パーソン・ストリーマーの違いについて明確に尋ねたところ、ほとんどのインタビュイーは、最初は両者に大きな違いはないと答えた。しかし、よくよく考えてみると、ほとんどの人が暗黙のうちにいくつかの重要な違いを感じていることを述べていました。4.3.1 ストリーマーの行動への期待の違い。VTuber のアバターは 2 次元や 3 次元の「仮想」の形をしているため、VTuber は「仮想世界にいる」という意識を無意識に持っているとインタビュー対象者は指摘している。また、VTuber を見ていると、ゲームやアニメ、漫画などの仮想世界に対する期待と同じように、仮想世界に対する期待規範が異なると感じたという。"人間のストリーマーが「自分は異空間から来ました」と言ったら、それは嘘っぽくておかしいと感じます。しかし、VTuber がそれを言っても違和感はありません。彼女は仮想世界にいるのだから、彼女が言うことは仮想世界のことであり、不可能なことはほとんどないのだと思う。"視聴者は仮想世界で起こりうることへの期待が異なるため、実生活では恥ずかしい、受け入れられない、不適切な行動でも、VTuber の文脈では普通、受け入れられる、適切であることが多い。例えば、視聴者は、VTuber の汚い言葉や攻撃的な言葉、「愚かな」行動に寛容であるように見える。でも、彼女はバーチャル・キャラクターだから、そういうことをしても構わないと思っている。それが彼女のかわいらしさでもあります。もし、人間のストリーマーがそのような行動をしたら、私は恥ずかしいし、あまりにもおかしいと思うでしょう」。P2）何人かのインタビュイーは、ストリーマーが視聴者からバーチャルギフトを募る傾向があることについてコメントしていますが、これは中国のライブストリーミングによく見られるユニークな報酬メカニズムです。彼らは、一部の実在のストリーマーがバーチャルギフトを勧誘する行為を嫌ったり、多くのお金を稼いでいるストリーマーに嫉妬したり、批判したりしていた。俗物的だと思うからです。プレゼントを贈った人のランキングを強調しすぎる。自分の配信に力を入れることなく、視聴者にお金を要求するだけだから」（P3）。しかし、VTuber の勧誘行為は、インタビューを受けた人たちには受け入れられているようだ。何人かのインタビュアーは、お金儲けに熱心なペルソナを持つ VTuber、神楽メアを挙げている。彼女の勧誘行為は、彼女のファンには受け入れられている、あるいは好意的に受け止められているようです。例えば、「彼女の勧誘行為は、彼女が自分のペルソナのように振る舞っていることがほとんどだと思います。彼女は本当に俗物的ではないし、お金に困っているわけでもない。彼女の勧誘は、彼女が自分の人格のように振舞っていることがほとんどだと思う。また、「VTuber へのプレゼントは、ゲームでいうところのバーチャルグッズのようなもの。実在の人物にチップを渡す感覚ではない」（P3）などの意見があった。4.3.2 距離感の問題 ライブ・ストリームを見ているときに、VTuber との距離感が、リアルな人間のストリーマーよりも遠いと感じていることが報告された。この距離感は、アバターを操作している中の人のリアルな表情や非言語的な情報を視聴者が直接見ることができないという、アバターとの仮想的な媒介関係に起因するものであると考えられる。VTuber のライブ配信を見ていると、仮面をかぶった俳優の演技を見ているような気分になる。この距離感は、VTuber のペルソナによってさらに強調される。多くの VTuber は、エキゾチック、ヴァンパイア、デビル、プリンセス、フェアリー、エイリアン、フューチャリスティックなど、特定のアイデンティティを持ってデザインされており、アバターの視覚的な外見もそれらのアイデンティティに沿ったものとなっています。P13 は、「VTuber を見て、リアルタイムでコメントして、自分のコメントが VTuber に読まれたり、反応されたりするのは、生身の人間から反応されるのとは違うと思う。たとえキャラクターの後ろに人間がいたとしても、別の世界のバーチャルなものと対話しているような感覚です。" このような距離感によって、視聴者は、中の人の外見などよりも、ライブ配信の実際の内容に注目するようになる。例えば、「アバターは、内容やパフォーマンスに注目する雰囲気を作り、VTuber の背後にいる実在の人物から、パフォーマンスや内容、ストーリーを隔離する」（P5）。4.3.3 公的なペルソナとアイデンティティー 芸能人やストリーマーのペルソナが暗黙的なものであるのに対し、VTuber のペルソナは明快なものであると認識している。彼らは次のように報告している。

4.3 Perceived
Differences between VTuber and Real-Person Streamers All interviewees had watched both real-person streamers and VTubers, especially those promoted by the platform, and they tended to watch VTubers more than real-person streamers. When asked explicitly about the differences they perceived between VTubers and real-person streamers, most interviewees first reported no significant differences between the two. However, upon reflection, most of them implicitly mentioned several key differences they perceived. 4.3.1 Different Expectations for Streamers’ Behaviors. Interviewees noted that because a VTuber’s avatar is in a 2-D or 3-D “virtual” form, they unconsciously adopted a mindset that the VTuber was “in the virtual world”. They felt that when watching VTubers, they had different expected norms for the virtual world, similar to their expectations for the virtual worlds in games, anime, or comics. “If a human streamer says that she is from a different space, I would feel it is fake and strange. However, if a VTuber says this, I won’t think it strange. I think she is in the virtual world, so all she says is about the virtual world, where almost nothing is impossible. ”(P5) Because viewers have different expectations for what could happen in the virtual world, many behaviors that might be embarrassing, unacceptable, or inappropriate in real life could be normal, acceptable, and appropriate in VTubers’ contexts. For example, viewers seem more tolerant of VTubers’ dirty or offensive language or “stupid” behaviors, e.g., “I think sometimes she behaves in a stupid way, and her facial expression is dull. However, I know she is a virtual character, so such behaviors are acceptable. They make her cute. If a human streamer behaves like that, I will feel it embarrassing and too strange.” (P2) Several interviewees commented on streamers’ inclinations to solicit virtual gifts from viewers, a unique reward mechanism prevalent within live streaming in China. They disliked some real-person streamers’ solicitation behaviors for virtual gifts and were jealous of, and had judgements about, streamers who earned much money, e.g., “I don’t like to watch real-person streamers, such as beautiful girls singing. I think they are snobbish. They emphasize the leaderboard of top gift-senders too much. They only ask for money from viewers without putting effort into their streams.”(P3). However, VTubers’ solicitation behaviors seemed more acceptable to interviewees. Several interviewees mentioned Kagura Mea, a VTuber who has a persona of being enthusiastic to make money and often asks for gifting during her streams. Her acts of solicitation were seen as acceptable, or even favored, by her fans, e.g., “I think her solicitation is mostly that she acts like her persona. She is not really snobbish or money-mad. When she asks for gifts, it is cute, and I like it” (P8). Interviewees also seemed more willing to purchase virtual gifts for their favorite VTubers, e.g., “Purchasing virtual gifts for VTubers seems like purchasing virtual goods in games. It feels less like tipping to a real person” (P3). 4.3.2 Sense of Distance. Interviewees reported that they felt more distant from VTubers than real-person streamers when watching live streams. This sense of distance partly originated from their virtual mediation with the avatar, wherein viewers could not directly see the real facial expressions or other non-verbal cues of the Nakanohito controlling the avatar, as noted by P3, “Watching VTubers’ live streams is like watching the performance of an actor wearing a mask. Although I know there is a human behind the avatar, it feels different and she becomes more distant”. The sense of distance is further enhanced by the persona of the VTuber. Many VTubers are designed with a specific identity, e.g., exotic, vampire, devil, princess, fairy, alien, or futuristic, and the visual appearances of these avatars aligned with these identities. Due to these unique identities and appearances, VTubers were perceived less like a human, and thus, more distant from viewers, as described by P13, “When I am watching VTubers and commenting in real time, and my comments get read and responded by VTubers, I think it is different from getting responses from a real-person streamer. It is like interacting with something virtual, from a different world, even if there’s a human behind the character.” This sense of distance causes viewers to pay more attention to the actual content of live streams than the appearance or other characteristics of the Nakanohito, e.g., “The avatar creates an atmosphere where I pay more attention to the content and performance, and isolate the performance, content, and stories from the real person behind the VTuber” (P5). 4.3.3 Public Personas and Identities. Interviewees perceived that unlike real celebrities or streamers whose public personas are more implicit, the public personas of VTubers are more explicit and obvious. They reported that every time a new VTuber begins to stream, a self introduction video is produced and widely shared online to explicitly provide basic information about the persona of the VTuber. CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Zhicong Lu et al. The video often includes background stories of the virtual character, hisher persona, and characteristics. Such videos are an important on-boarding experience for viewers and drum up initial interests in a VTuber. However, interviewees believed that there were diverse practices with respect to the degree to which streamers’ behaviors aligned with a designed persona and also that personas were often temporally dynamic. The personas that VTubers have created tend to follow commonplace anime or manga persona templates that seem simple and “flat”, combining personality elements that are known to be attractive to subculture community members. As the Japanese philosopher Azuma Hiroki commented, anime personas are often constructed out of the ‘moe (affection) database’ [18]. VTubers usually have one core characteristic that stood out to ensure that their persona was less complicated than a real human, which often makes them unique and popular, e.g., “Nekomiya Hinata has a persona of a cute girl with cat ears, who is skillful in playing FPS (first person shooter) games. She really impressed me in her famous stream where she killed 16 players in PUBG” (P6). Some VTubers strictly aligned with such original ideal personas, thus transforming a Nakanohito into a role player. Kizuna Ai is an example of such a role-playing VTuber and is presented as a cute, cheerful and occasionally careless girl that is commonly seen in anime and manga. Viewers can easily grasp the simple persona of this VTuber and the impression of cuteness that she exudes accumulates and is reinforced with every exposure a viewer has to her stream. Other VTubers’ personas can be more flexible, e.g., diverging from the originally designed persona, with some even disclosing the Nakanohito’s characteristics or real life. The discrepancy between the designed persona and the presented image of the VTuber has become more and more prevalent for emerging VTubers. The contrast between the initial and evolving personas can make a VTuber’s content more fun to watch, e.g., “Many new VTubers start from an interesting introduction video about the persona, which attracts many viewers’ attention. However, after they officially started streaming, everyone is astonished, because they do not act like the persona at all” (P5). The personality elements that compose the designed personas, while well-accepted, may feel familiar or even repetitive to some long-time VTuber viewers. Interviewees noted that some VTubers intentionally have a conflicting personality to generate “drama and conflict” (P11) to attract viewers. Others noted that this discrepancy is due to the differences between Nakanohito’s personalities and designed personas. Through streaming regularly, Nakanohitos’ personalities and styles are often revealed unconsciously, gradually transforming into the VTuber’s persona, e.g., “I can see some of the Nakanohito’s real reactions in some cases, and it tells me about the style or personality of her” (P15). 4.3.4 Situational Changes in Persona. Public personas also undergo situational changes with viewers’ preferences. While some VTubers gain initial popularity due to the discrepancies between their designed and presented personas, this becomes a challenge when they begin to gain traction. As they become more popular, a presented persona may not continue to attract followers because the discrepancies might only appeal to a niche group of viewers. In this case, many VTubers have to adjust their personas so that they cater to a broader audience and avoid losing followers. This happened with Kagura Mea, e.g., “Mea was famous for her dirty language and absurd behaviors. However, now she’s more popular than before, she intentionally reduces the use of dirty language to avoid attracting trolls”(P7). Explicit persona changes also provide opportunities to generate interactions between viewers and VTubers, e.g., “We often make fun of the VTuber by mentioning her persona when she behaves inconsistently with her persona. She will seriously explain her behaviors with excuses. It looks very absurd and beyond the reality for us, and hard to explain ”(P21). Due to the performative nature of VTubers, it is hard to determine whether deviations from a VTuber’s designed persona result from intentional planning to attract viewership or from the Nakanohito’s personality blending in. The highly commercial and viewership-driven atmosphere among VTubers also results in their identities being more fluid between the ends of the spectrum and open to changes to maintain viewer appeal. 4.3.5 Presence through Multiple Channels. Interviewees also mentioned that VTubers extend their virtual lives and presence into the real world using many different channels. Interviewees provided several examples of VTubers’ growth into anime, comics, garage kits (i.e., model figures portraying anime characters), video games, novels, and traditional radio broadcasting channels. For example, several popular VTubers have anime and comics that tell stories about their characters and their imaginary lives. Video games that enable fans to role play as a friend of their favorite VTuber and interact with them are also popular in Japan. VTubers also travel to offline events to meet their fans, i.e., they are shown on a public large display and interact with fans in real time. Most interviewees were interested in such artefacts and perceived them as a way to stay connected with their favorite VTubers in real life, in the real world. They also regarded these artefacts (e.g., garage kit) as a way to extend VTubers “physically” in the real world, and they desired to purchase them to support their favorite VTubers, e.g., “I think through buying a garage kit of her, I get a copy of her in the real world which can be with me. It is also my way to support her” (P8). 4.4 Perceptions of Nakanohito Disembodiment and Nakanohito’s Labor A Nakanohito (中の人) is the person performing behind an avatar who provides the VTuber’s voice and controls their movements. A proficient Nakanohito must have a pleasant voice and talent for generating interesting conversations with viewers during live streams. Although they play a pivotal role in VTubers’ performances and interactions with viewers, a VTuber’s Nakanohito remains invisible throughout most live streams. Most Nakanohitos do not disclose their personal identity to the public, due to privacy concerns or corporations’ policies. Even for those who do disclose some of their personal information to the public, VTubers’ identities are mostly determined by the persona of the virtual avatar that was initially set by the company or the streamer rather than the Nakanohito’s identity. For example, Tsukudani Norio (佃煮のりお) is a female manga artist, who is the Nakanohito of a popular male VTuber More Kawaii than a Real-Person Streamer CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Inuyama Tamaki (犬山たまき). Although viewers know that a female is portraying a male character, many viewers are still attracted to the persona of the virtual avatar. They enjoy watching a unique show wherein Tsukudani Norio and Inuyama Tamaki stream simultaneously talking to each other, as if they were co-streaming (Figure 3). The degree of disembodiment between Nakanohitos and their virtual avatars is unique in virtual live streaming, as it brings forth challenges related to identity management and user engagement. 4.4.1 Intentionally Maintaining Nakanohito and Avatar Disembodiment. Interviewees noted that the VTuber community agreed that personal information about Nakanohitos is sensitive and viewers should avoid talking about it online. For example, on the VTuber sub-forum of NGA, the first rule was that discussions about the identity of Nakanohitos and disclosing their personal information was prohibited (Figure 4). These community members actively maintain the disembodiment of VTubers by limiting the spread of Nakanohito’s personal information. Most interviewees reported that although they were curious about Nakanohitos, they had little interest in knowing their identities and they denounced behaviors relating to prying into Nakanohitos’ privacy, e.g., “I tend not to know or ask about Nakanohitos’ identities. Their privacy should be respected” (P8). Some interviewees noted that rules about not discussing Nakanohito’s personal information are required or suggested by corporations or other stakeholders, because “their strategies are to make Nakanohito more invisible to avoid risks or trouble. Prohibiting discussions about Nakanohito could be good for their Figure 3: Tsukudani Norio talking with her own VTuber avatar in a live stream. Left: Tsukudani Norio talking in her real identity; Right: Tsukudani Norio talking as VTuber Inuyama Tamaki with her own face covered. Figure 4: Rules of NGA’s VTuber subforum. Translation of text: (1) Discussing a Nakanohitoe’s identity is prohibited, unless it has been disclosed implicitly in activities; (2) Discussing accidentally leaked Nakanohito personal information is prohibited; (3) Under certain circumstances, discussions about certain Nakanohito-related topics may be allowed by the forum committee. operation and management” (P13). Interestingly, most community members supported and followed these rules even if they knew that they were for corporate interests. 4.4.2 Maintaining the Disembodiment of Nakanohitos to Maintain Perfect Impressions. Some interviewees intentionally supported disembodiment for the sake of maintaining the perfect image of the virtual avatar in their mind, e.g., “In some cases, if I know that the Nakanohito is totally different from her persona, for example, if her style is not as cute as the avatar. I may get very disappointed and feel uncomfortable when watching her videos or streams, even abandon her” (P8). This misogyny sentiment may root from preferences for cuteness in the Otaku community [27], the psychological distance they perceived with the VTuber, and that they perceived the VTuber more as a character than as a real person. Because Nakanohitos are behind the scenes and only disclose or alter their voice when streaming, viewers have limited information to infer about Nakanohitos’ real personalities and identities. On the other hand, virtual avatars often have well-designed persona settings and background stories which often leave “perfect impressions” on viewers. As time goes on, viewers may begin to believe that the Nakanohito is also as perfect as the virtual avatar. For some viewers, seeing the real side of the Nakanohito would ruin the fantasy in their mind, e.g., “VTuber is perfect in the virtual world. We should keep a distance from the Nakanohito to appreciate her performance. Watching up close will ruin the fantasy. Someone tried to dig out information about Kagura Mea’s Nakanohito. He found a photo of her that does not align with his imagination. He was so disappointed that he never watched her streams again. But actually the Nakanohito did not post her photos online.” (P10) 4.4.3 Indifference towards Corporations Replacing Nakanohitos. The disembodiment of Nakanohito and virtual avatars is also reflected by indifferent attitudes towards replacing Nakanohitos. All interviewees mentioned cases where Nakanohitos were replaced by agencies, e.g., Kizuna Ai’s case. When asked to reflect on how they would feel if their favorite VTuber’s Nakanohito were replaced, most interviewees did not think it would matter. Some interviewees cared most about the quality of the content they experienced with a VTuber, which was often the outcome of teamwork, rather than a Nakanohito’s own efforts. In these cases, the influence of Nakanohitos on their experiences was limited, e.g., “Many shallow viewers will not notice that the Nakanohito is replaced if the quality of the streams and personas remain unchanged... If the team is professional, it is achievable even if Nakanohito is replaced”(P4). Some interviewees thought that replacing the Nakanohito with a more experienced one would provide better quality content. They cared more about the Nakanohito’s skill set than the person, e.g., “The Nakanohito is essential for a VTuber, but she is not the entire project. If the new one is interesting enough, I will keep watching her live streams” (P6). Some interviewees considered the possibility of replacing Nakanohito as a unique feature. For example, P11 noted that having different Nakanohitos for one VTuber was similar to a person journeying CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Zhicong Lu et al. through different life stages, which could bring new levels of freshness and engagement, “I prefer to think in this way that VTuber can grow over time just like human ... Different Nakanohitos represent the VTuber in different life stages, but it is the same VTuber. I will accept this if the company transfers Nakanohitos smoothly”. 4.4.4 Viewers Care about Fairness for Nakanohitos’ Labor. Although most interviewees could accept the replacement of a Nakanohito, they felt that they were owed a proper reason for this change in personnel. In particular, they cared about Nakanohitos’ working conditions and fair treatment. In 2019 April, four Nakanohitoes in the Game Club project accused the Unlimited operating company of unfair treatment, including overtime work and sexual harassment. The company soon replaced all four Nakanohitos. In response to this, the Game Club project was eventually terminated due to a boycott from the viewer community. On the other hand, the viewers can accept the replacement if there are appropriate reasons. For example, the Nakanohito of one of ReVdol’s VTubers resigned for personal reasons, and viewers mostly supported her choice. All interviewees mentioned that they would not accept a new Nakanohito without confirming that the original Nakanohito was treated fairly. For example, P4 mentioned that “It’s an awful thing to change Nakanohito only because the company wants to make more money.”. P3 stated that, “we won’t forgive the company if they abuse a Nakanohito”. 5 DISCUSSION Our study uncovered many novel facets of VTuber live streaming. We now reflect and highlight our key findings, situate our results with prior research, and discuss insights and implications for HCI. 5.1 Multi-Layer Identity and the Line between Virtual and Real in Live Streaming Our findings suggest that VTuber live streaming is a form of performance where the virtual and the real worlds converge. However, the boundaries between real and virtual selves are ever-changing, thus influencing social interactions. These results first provide evidence that in VTuber live streaming, where viewers watch performances of Nakanohitos through the mediation of a virtual avatar, viewer’s interpretations of the avatar depend on a number of factors, and do not always align with the Hyperpersonal Model of CMC [61, 62]. Viewers’ motivations to watch VTuber may be an important factor. On one hand, some viewers who are more attracted by the virtual avatar and its persona may be more strict about the consistency between VTuber’s behaviors and personas. They may often over-interpret cues from an avatar who has a simple and straight-forward persona and unique appearance. Viewers can thus form a close-to-perfect impression of a VTuber and follow her like fans, which aligns with the Hyperpersonal Model. These fans seem to maintain a unique tie to the avatar, similar to fandom in the anime domain. On the other hand, some viewers regard VTubers as friends and enjoy when VTubers share details about their daily life with them, either fictional or from the Nakanohito’s real life. For these viewers, consistency between VTuber’s behaviors and persona is less important because they care more about the personality or even the ‘character’ of the Nakanohito, which is the presented self of the Nakanohito behind the anime mask of the virtual avatar. This is often not the intention of VTubers and does not align with the Hyperpersonal Model. Such multiple layers of identity may be the reason why some viewers may have conflicting interpretations of the avatar and Nakanohito. Viewers have agency to selectively interpret and creatively engage with VTubers’ multiple identities. The content that VTubers live stream is a mixture of virtual and real. VTubers build their virtual world persona by providing content based on their skills and experiences in the real world, resulting in a sense of distance between the VTuber and their viewers. This persona constructs the virtual identity of the VTuber, which echoes prior research [39]. We further show that viewers’ interactions in live-streams and social networks (e.g. fan groups) also affect VTubers’ identity construction. The unpredictability of live streams can contribute to more stories that viewers co-experience with a VTuber and these stories gradually merge into a VTuber’s persona. Viewers’ interactions within the community, encouraged by the creation and spreading of memes, can further add to VTubers’ online identities. Because the line between virtual and real in VTuber streaming is dynamic and blurry, viewers often do not consider a virtual avatar and the Nakanohito separately, but rather, regard the VTuber as a character in the virtual world and thus less subject to real world social norms. This mindset makes viewers more tolerant to VTubers’ inappropriate behaviors and may contribute to viewers’ indifferent attitudes towards agencies replacing Nakanohitos. However, where the virtuality-reality boundary of VTubers lies varies on individual viewers and may be shifted by external influences. Occasionally, the complexity of reality cuts in and breaks the illusion. A notable example occurred when the virtual “side” collapsed when viewers found out, through collective actions within the community (e.g., boycotts), that agencies were mistreating Nakanohitos and replacing them without an acceptable reason. This echoes findings of Kou et al. [32] about the importance of collective actions in seeking transparency and fairness in spaces mediated by virtual avatars. 5.2 Corporations Roles and the Labor of (Virtual) Live Streamers Previous literature has discussed labor issues in the live streaming industry. For example, Woodcock and Johnson [65] used the theoretical lenses of affective and immaterial labor to explore a range of streamer activities on Twitch (e.g., building para-social intimacy with spectators, soliciting donations, etc.), and called for more efforts to study live streaming as part of the landscape of contemporary digital work. Contributing to this line of research, these results showed how dedicated viewers perceive and care about the labor in live streaming, i.e., the often hidden and invisible labor of Nakanohitos. Unlike real-person streamers who can build their personal brand and be rewarded [44, 64], it is hard for Nakanohitos to conduct personal branding, as they are mostly behind the scenes of a stream. For VTubers, the brand and emotional attachments from viewers are mostly for the virtual avatar. This could be why some viewers had indifferent attitudes towards corporations replacing Nakanohitos. More Kawaii than a Real-Person Streamer CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Additionally, most of the time, the intellectual property of the avatar and the technologies required for producing VTuber content belongs to a corporation, which places a Nakanohito at a disadvantaged position. A corporation could change Nakanohitos at any time, without much cost. This is an extreme example of consumer capitalism in pop culture in East Asia, in that a virtual idol’s lack of an autonomous existence “makes her an interchangeable and disposable image commodity” [19]. This also reminds us that as the live streaming industry grows and becomes more lucrative, new forms of labor exploitation may also emerge. Currently, we have a limited understanding of the labor contributed by different types of streamers, including Nakanohito, and of the policy options that might be leveraged to regulate the industry and to protect labor rights. 5.3 VTuber Live Streaming Challenges By exploring the emerging VTuber live streaming, we unveiled several unique challenges that virtual live streamers have and compare our findings to prior research to provide insights into the professionalism of live streamers. 5.3.1 Constructing Virtual Identities. Dedicated viewers perceived that VTubers construct their identities dynamically through stories and performances to attract viewers with different tastes or to intentionally reveal parts of a Nakanohito’s personality or life to generate contrast and amuse viewers. These results echo findings about the identity reassembling of fashion bloggers on Second Life, in that “a virtual body is only a slice of the continuum of ongoing identity reassemblin” [39]. VTubers’ online identities are mediated through ever-changing avatar bodies and Nakanohito’s real identities. Live streaming viewers also have a profound impact on VTubers’ identities. Their comments during live streams create moments that complement and transform streamers’ existing personas and their interactions go beyond the live streams, e.g., spreading memes created during live streams in group chats and other fan communities. VTubers’ personalities usually begin with simple designs, but evolve to be more complicated through the interactions they have with viewers. This creates challenges for VTubers. As their virtual identities become more complex and viewers’ expectations change dynamically, Nakanohitos cannot effectively maintain a consistent persona or image, which will potentially lead them to lose fans. 5.3.2 Changeable or Multiple Nakanohitos. VTubers are unique in that the avatar and the Nakanohito are intentionally disembodied by both the community and a corporation. Because of this, VTubers could have Nakanohitos replaced or even have multiple Nakanohitos performing different content behind the same avatar together or separately. For example, two Nakanohitos could stream together, with one focusing on playing a game and another on interacting with viewers. Different Nakanohitos could also take turns delivering content that they have expertise in to viewers. It is surprising that viewers are accepting these practices, as long as the quality of the content remains untainted and the process is transparent. These practices, however, bring challenges to VTubers’ teams. Changing Nakanohito sometimes also changes the talking style or other traits of the VTuber, which may again leads to a loss of fans. 5.3.3 Content Diversity. As discussed in 4.2.4, VTubers can not perform in an expressive manner as real-person streamers can due to technology constraints. Firstly, VTubers cannot provide content involving physical interactions with the real world which is the stage for many popular streaming genres, such as handcrafting tutorials [41] or travel experience sharing [42]. While there have been attempts by VTubers to co-stream with real-person streamers, the presence of VTubers can only be fixed to computer displays in physical environments. Moreover, in contrast to the characters in other computer graphic experiences such as games or animated movies, VTuber avatars rarely interact with the virtual environments they reside in, missing out on opportunities for enhanced narratives and storytelling. 5.4 Design Implications Our findings about VTuber relates to the ongoing discussion in HCI and CSCW about inclusive live streaming, AI-mediated communication [28], and deception on social media. With virtual avatars, people who are unwilling to disclose their disabilities or imperfections may feel more comfortable broadcasting their talents and sharing stories through live streaming by constructing a different identity. With more and more advanced AI technology, automatically generating the appearance of different virtual idols, creating character designs and background stories, or even altering voices, will become much easier. Some companies have already begun creating fully AI-powered TV program hosts that use machine learning to simulate the voice, facial expressions, and gestures of real-life hosts [33]. We now detail several design considerations which should inform the design, implementation, and exploration of future live streaming services. 5.4.1 Design for Identity Management. Our results highlight that VTubers construct their identities dynamically, often evolving them over time based on characteristics of Nakanohitos or viewers community participation. Further, VTubers could have different Nakanohitos or even multiple Nakanohitos who collaborate to perform. Due to this potential complexity, maintaining a consistent identity will remain challenging for VTubers but is crucial to maintaining a stable fan base. There is thus a design opportunity to provide collaborative identity managing tools for VTubers, which could provide Nakanohitos with guidelines and actionable strategies to maintain a consistent identity during live streams. For example, when viewers send comments that risk revealing the identity of a Nakanohito during a live stream, the tool could alert the Nakanohito about the risk and guide them to respond to the comments in manner consistent with their constructed identity. Such tools may also need to tailor their output to different Nakanohitos if there are multiple Nakanohitos performing for one VTuber. While future natural language processing may make these features automatic, current streamers could rely on an “assistant” to help them flag risky comments and provide suggestions for maintaining identity, similar to the role of moderators [63]. 5.4.2 Design for Transparency and Fairness. Replacing Nakanohito or having multiple Nakanohitos is a unique dynamic within VTuber live streaming. While interviewees were fine with this when the CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Zhicong Lu et al. quality of content remained consistent and the process was transparent and fair to Nakanohito, it was hard for viewers to determine if a Nakanohito was replaced without notice, and if they found out after the fact, they have been known to boycott the corporation. It is thus necessary for corporations to make the invisible labor of Nakanohitos more visible by disclosing information such as whether the Nakanohitos are treated fairly by the corporation, for example, not working overtime or being replaced without a convincing reason. The health or emotional states of Nakanohitos can also be made known to the viewers to some extent although care must be taken to protect Nakanohito’s privacy. 5.4.3 Design for both the Virtual and the Real. Our findings also revealed the opportunities that can occur when blurring the line between the real and the virtual through VTubers’ live streaming. VTubers’ live streams suggest creative performance forms that could inspire real-person live streamers. Interviewees showed great enthusiasm towards watching multiple VTubers co-located in one virtual world. Most current real-person co-streaming, however, only displays the juxtaposition of multiple streamers’ videos on the screen. This suggests a design opportunity to break geographic barriers and bring the co-streaming experience of VTubers to realperson streamers, using technologies such as markerless motion capture. Future Mixed Reality technologies could enhance viewers’ experiences of VTuber live streams. Augmented reality could bring human-sized 3D avatars of VTubers to the real world. Virtual reality could immerse the viewers in the the virtual world where the VTuber performs. Live streaming that blurs the real and the virtual has the potential to be further combined with specific application areas, such as cultural heritage, tourism, and knowledge sharing, to better engage broader viewership. 5.5 Limitations and Future Work We note several limitations of our study that should be considered when interpreting this work. Our study drew from the interview data of a sample of dedicated viewers that skewed young and male. Future research is needed to expand and deepen our understanding of the VTuber community with a larger and more diverse sample, even in different countries. Due to the nature of this study, causal conclusions or generalizability of the findings could not be made. Interviewing different stakeholders, such as Nakanohitos of VTubers, their moderators, other supporting roles, and managers of corporations could probably reveal more insights about this phenomenon. Alternative methodology where participants are invited to engage with a particular set of VTubers with their reactions to VTubers analyzed in a controlled experiment could also be explored in future research. 6 CONCLUSION This work examined how the Otaku community engages with and perceive VTubers. The results revealed that the content and viewer motivations of VTuber live streaming were similar to real-person streamers. Viewers, however, perceived VTubers differently from real-person streamers by holding different expectations for VTuber’s behaviors and feeling a stronger sense of distance towards them. Viewers also intentionally maintained the disembodiment of Nakanohitos from avatars to preserve VTubers’ perfect images, though they still cared about the Nakanohito with respect to labor fairness and transparency. By identifying unique challenges that viewers and VTubers encounter within the realm of live streaming, e.g., collaborative identity management and limited interactions with the real world, these results could inspire the design of future live streaming platforms and enable the community to better understand the influence and effects of VTubers or even AI-powered virtual streamers, on audiences.
