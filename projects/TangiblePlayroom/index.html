<p class="text"><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p class="text">&quot;Tangible Playroom&quot; was designed as a future computer
entertainment system for children. It can provide
some Virtual Reality contents with a safe force feed back and a large floor
image. Players can interact with content's world using their full body. To feel
force feedback, player grasps a tangible
(graspable, perceptible by touch) grip like a cork ball. It is linked to encoder
motors by strings. Then it can input 3D location to system. When player touch to
some objects, system calculate a correct force feedback to player via string and
tangible grip. Our system can provide high quality force representation with
safe rather than metal linked arm system.</p>

<p class="text">&quot;Penguin Hockey&quot; is a
typical demonstration content. It is a simple 3D hockey game playing with automotive penguins. The pucks are snowmen. To get points,
players should throw snowmen to the enemy's goal hole. Our software has a real-time dynamics simulator then children can interact with computer-generated
characters with real reactions.</p>

      Players can interact with this system with their full body. The girl can
      feel force feedback via tangible grip. It is attached by strings to
      encoder motors inside wall column. The grip can change to other tangible
      toys.

<p class="text">Tangible Playroom was designed as a future computer
entertainment system for children. &quot;Tangible&quot; means
&quot;graspable&quot; or &quot;perceptible by touch&quot;. It is important
experience for children especially infancy periods (3-5 years old). Haptics or
touchable Virtual Reality can render these stimulus. However, there are not so
many examples for children using haptics hardware. So this project focused on &quot;interesting
haptic experience for children&quot; .
</p>

<p class="text"> 
We feel some problems about current game content or system. Then we
focused 3 points below:
</p>

<p class="text"><b>(1) Can play in normal room space like a living room.<br>
(2) Can play by body and direct interaction.<br>
(3) Can show a law in nature world.</b>
</p>

<p class="text">These are our philosophy of design. For example, normal room space is a&nbsp;natural educational
space for children. Playing by body is felt a little tire. But it stops
unlimited play and motion insufficiency. Current game system is not enough for
these points.&nbsp;(3) means natural physics, dynamics and&nbsp; Artificial Intelligences.
We think rendering physics like falling or crashing is good for edutainment
(education + entertainment) stance. Recently, some current game systems have
this concept.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="text">Our prototype system has a tangible grip made by a cork ball.
The 4 encoder motors and strings are pulling it. When player grasp it, our
system can calculate its 3D location using length of 4 strings. If it collides
to other objects in Virtual Reality world, each motors pulls the tangible grip
via strings. This method named as SPIDAR (SPace Interface of Artificial Reality,
M.Sato, 1991). It can represent force feedback safety.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="text">For making immersive image projection, we use floor screen. It
allows players to walk and touch. And when we set our projector to 4m height,
the floor image size is 2x3m large. If children's tall height is 100-150cm then.
It can cover the all of their view.
</p>

<p class="text">For controlling encoder motors, we use our self developed amp
box using USB.2.0. It connected to PC. Same PC can use for generating graphics.
Then our system can run least one PC.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="text"> The goal of our project is implementing encoder motors and
projectors to room corner's column. However, we move this prototype system for
research or demonstration now.

&quot;Penguin Hockey&quot; is a
typical demonstration content for Tangible Playroom. It is a simple 3D hockey game playing with
automotive penguins. The pucks are snowmen. To get score,
players should throw snowmen to the enemy's goal hole.<p>This software has a real-time dynamics simulator. All of objects behave under
rigid body dynamics. They also have their weight and center of gravity. When
players interact with computer-generated
characters like penguin or pucks, they can feel the difference of weight between
penguin and puck.</p>
<p>
A typical play style is collaborating with the automotive penguin of same team and throwing in pucks to
enemy's goal hole. But subsidiary players who doesn't have a grip can join same
time, because the floor screen is too large for children's view. If subsidiary
(or just waiting) players help for main player to tell whole characters
location. It means making a cooperative communication using off-line space in
our system. We think it is important design for children's game system.</p>
<p>When the penguins of rival groups block their goal by their movement. Player
should push penguins by full body movement. If player make a collision to them,
system represents heavy feel and penguins' voice.</p>
<p>This content was designed like interactive bricks toy having automotive wills
and dynamics. Then to get a win isn't so important. Collaborating with penguin, throwing in pucks
sharply or touching some characters are just interesting experiences.</p>
<p>There are results from visitor who played &quot;Penguin Hockey&quot; at an exhibition.
In this case, we installed our prototype system at an event that was prepared for children including handicapped individuals (August 1-7th, 2001 in Osaka Japan). From all players, we got their impressions
by questionnaire. There were 361 persons who had played in 7 days. No injured
children are there. Numbers of players in the age of 12 or below was 336 (93%). Average age in this group was 7.53. The youngest was aged 1. The ratio of gender is 57/42 (boys/girls). 97% of players answered [Joyful/Amused]. 93% of players could touch the virtual objects. In answer to the question, “How
do you feel when you touch these Invisible objects?” 45% replied with [wonder/mysterious] and 29% replied with [Amused].
We can find a difference about reply for this question between 3-5 (infancy) and
higher age. Infancy feel haptics as [Amused] but higher age feel it as
[wonder/mysterious]. We think this result reasons by growing of recognition. We
also asked for the player’s favorite TV game title, and we asked that, “In addition, do you like our “penguin hockey” rather than your favorite?”
later. Then 59% children said [Yes].&nbsp;</p>

        </b>In this case, the penguin is 5 times heavier than the puck. And for
        faster collision detection, penguin's physical shape was rounded as same
        as snowman.

      <td width="50%" valign="top">Tangible Playroom is an generic entertainment
        system. Then it should be able to represent other VR worlds.
        <p>We plan some of content examples for Tangible Playroom now. Especially,
        it can represent force and haptics with safe. Additionally, tangible
        grip can change for other tangible toys. It looks like ROM cartridge on
        current game systems.</p>
        <p>Upper picture is one of examples for future application, &quot;A
        geographic sandbox&quot;. It looks likes a Virtual Kindergarten's
        sandbox. But floor screen shows players neighborhood map. The girl can
        make and touch a dune her self. Now a boy is kicking to break the dune
        but he will miss because of it is just an image. She just can touch her
        geo design.</p>
        <p>Lower picture is one of examples using image recognizer, &quot;A hot
        air balloon simulator&quot;. The tangible grip is a hot air balloon. A
        girl grasps a fan. Image recognizer can detect her motion, then it makes
        a wind to the balloon. Tangible Playroom can represent force then they
        can feel a wind force via balloon. Of course, it can change to other
        tangible toy like a plane.</p>
        <p>These examples are just a plan now. However this isn't a dream when
        our system becomes usual.</td>

<p class="text"> <b> Requirements for demonstration</b>
</p>

<p class="text"> To install our demonstration system and show &quot;Penguin
Hockey&quot;, we need more than 2x2m large floor and semi dark room for projection.
To project the proper size images, we need more than 4m length. If the roof is higher than 4m, we need a hanger for projector.
But if it's lower, we'll prepare a mirror to reflect the images from the projector which is set on the floor,
so, we need to hang a mirror on the ceiling. And the projector may cost 225W. We also prepare Windows
PC (notebook) which costs 75W. And connect amp box for haptic via USB2.0. which costs 150W.
