Project Title: Wiiolin
Creator: Jace Miller
Platform: Windows
API: Wiiuse for Wii remote interaction, also FMOD library for sound sample
playback
Short abstract: The Wiiolin is a virtual violin that uses Nintendo's Wii
controller and sensor bar to produce music in a unique way.  To play the
Wiiolin, the Wii remote is held in the left hand like the neck of a violin
and the sensor bar is used as a bow.  The motion and orientation of the
sensor bar is analyzed at interactive rates to determine which virtual
string is being played.  Button presses on the Wii remote are mapped to
similar finger positions on the violin.  The virtual bow motion and finger
position information is combined to determine which pre-recorded note sample
should be played.  Tilting the Wii remote downwards allows the Wiiolin to be
played like a cello, with sound samples to match the instrument.
Technical/artistic advantage: This is the only work I am aware of that
attempts to recognize sensor bar movement as a primary means of music
generation.

I'll have to check with the professor in charge of the Immersive
Visualization project at the university if he wants to publish information
about the immersive system that was displaying the ant colony scenes, but
I'll e-mail you back with the details if they agree.

Your book sounds like a good project.  Let me know when it is finished and I
may look for a copy of it.
